SMEs and startups need to embrace digital transformation. It’s to support this transformation that we created Cubiq.

Cubiq is more than just a collection of tools. It’s an [integrated ecosystem](https://www.cubiq.lat), designed to deliver affordable, modular, and intelligent solutions for growing businesses.

We began this journey inspired by companies like Every… and with an initial suite of products that will expand as our experiments are validated.

We’re launching with 4 products:

- **CARE**: IT asset management and leasing
- **STORE**: Custom headless e-commerce
- **PAY**: Cross-border BTC/USDT payments via Lightning
- **APIs**: For startups who want to leverage the technologies powering our own products

But there’s more in the experiment vault:

- **LAW**: A micropayment-powered tool that instantly analyzes global contracts for $4.99, identifying risks and suggesting legal edits—eliminating the initial need for expensive lawyers.
