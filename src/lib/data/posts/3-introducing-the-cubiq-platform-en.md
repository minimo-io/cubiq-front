Cubiq was born with the intention of supporting growing companies, SMEs, and startups that need a **reliable and efficient technology partner** to support their transformation.

Cubiq is more than a development company or a collection of tools. We are a <span>Digital Products Platform</span> and a <a href="/lab" class="text-primary">Development Laboratory</a> that designs, builds, and deploys proprietary products as well as custom-made solutions for third parties.

Our team provides the design and development that power the three service layers of our offering.

## The platform

Cubiq’s [integrated platform](https://www.cubiq.lat) is built on a foundation of 4 digital products:

- **[CARE](/en/care)**: IT asset management and rental.
- **[STORE](/en/store)**: Custom headless e-commerce.
- **[PAY](/en/pay)**: BTC/USDT payments with instant settlement and cross-border capabilities, via Lightning.
- **[APIs](https://api.cubiq.lat/)**: For startups that want to leverage the technologies powering our own products.

But there are more products being incubated in the laboratory:

- **LAW**: A micropayments tool that instantly analyzes global contracts, identifying risks and suggesting edits, removing the initial need for expensive lawyers.

We are also a <a href="/en/lab">DevLab</a>, offering custom development and a portfolio of proprietary products.

## The laboratory

Through its [Laboratory](https://www.cubiq.lat), Cubiq experiments with and creates proprietary products such as:

- **[BETIZEN](https://www.betizen.org/)**: The first listing platform for Casino, Binary Options, and Forex with the right incentives: karma, merit, and proof-of-work.
- **[HOPCHAIN](/en/blog/beer-app)** (formerly Ln-Beer): HopChain connects breweries and bitcoiners with frictionless payments in satoshis.

In addition, the same programming and design team from the laboratory builds custom solutions for third parties.
