Cubiq was born with the intention of supporting growing companies, SMEs, and Startups that need a reliable and efficient technology partner to accompany their transformation.

Cubiq is more than a development company or a collection of tools. We are a <span>Digital Products Platform</span> and a <a href="/en/lab" class="text-primary">Development Laboratory</a> that designs, builds, and deploys proprietary products as well as custom-made products for third parties.

Our team provides the design and development that power the three service layers of our offering.

<strong class="text-primary">//</strong> Here you can learn more about <a href="/en/#more">our technology stack</a>.

## The platform

Cubiq’s [integrated platform](https://www.cubiq.lat/en) is built on a base of 4 digital products:

- **[CARE](/en/care)**: IT asset management and rental.
- **[STORE](/en/store)**: Custom headless e-commerce.
- **[PAY](/en/pay)**: BTC/USDT payments with instant settlement and cross-border support via Lightning.
- **[APIs](https://api.cubiq.lat/)**: For startups that want to use the technologies that power our own products.

But there are more products being incubated in the laboratory:

- **LAW**: A micropayment tool that instantly analyzes global contracts, identifying risks and suggesting edits, eliminating the initial need for expensive lawyers.

We are also a <a href="/en/lab">DevLab</a>, offering custom development and a range of proprietary products.

## The laboratory

Through its [Laboratory](https://www.cubiq.lat), Cubiq experiments with and creates proprietary products such as:

- **[BETIZEN](https://www.betizen.org/)**: The first Casino, Binary Options, and Forex listings site with the right incentives: karma, merit, and proof-of-work.
- **[HOPCHAIN](/en/blog/beer-app)** (formerly Ln-Beer): HopChain connects breweries and bitcoiners with frictionless payments in satoshis.

Additionally, the same programming and design team from the laboratory creates custom solutions for third parties.
