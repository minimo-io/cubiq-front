HopChain is as a proof-of-concept app for those of us willing to use bitcoin as money, not just as one more speculative asset, so we can buy our craft 6-packs using satoshis, instead of just sitting above them.

Beers will be delivered by 3rd party #bitcoin friendly retail stores.

If you are a store owner and are interested please get in touch!
